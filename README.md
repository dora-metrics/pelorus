# Pelorus

Pelorus is a tool that helps IT organizations measure their impact on the overall performance on their organization. It does this by gathering metrics about team and organizational behaviors over time in some key areas of IT that have been shown to impact the value they deliver to the organization as a whole. Some of the key areas Pelorus focuses on are:

- Software Delivery Performance
- Product Performance and Adoption
- IT Platform Performance and Adoption
