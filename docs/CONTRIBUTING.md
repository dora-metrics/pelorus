# Contributing to Pelorus

//Table of Content goes here

## Types of contributions we’re looking for
* Resolving issues
* Contributing to Documentation
* Revise language to be more approachable and friendly

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and
that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We
all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely
have different perspectives on "how open source is done". Try to
listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution
passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address
them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please
don’t add references or links to things you or your employer have
created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## Getting set up for local development

Refer to the [Install Doc](./docs/Install.md) for the prerequisites on setting up and installing Pelorus.

    
## Contributing Content

Here is a link to the General Contribution Guidelines for the Red Hat Communities of Practice. It will cover some Do's and Dont's, such as forking a repo instead of creating a new branch.
[Contribution Guidelines](https://redhat-cop.github.io/contrib/)

If you’d like to contribute, start by searching through the GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus/pulls) to see
whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don’t see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals
of this guide, do one of the following: **If your contribution is
minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request. **If your contribution
is major,** such as a new article or category, start by opening an issue
first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
do any work.
