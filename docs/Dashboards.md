# Pelorus Dashboards

Pelorus dashboards show Key Performance Indicators that measure various [Bridge Outcomes](Philosophy.md#exploring-bridge-outcomes).

Learn what we measure and why on the [Our Philosophy](Philosophy.md) page.


## Terminology

Exporter
: Exporters enable Pelorus to customize data points to capture metrics from various providers.  
e.g. Deploy time exporter, Commit time exporter, Failure exporter

Provider
: The source from which exporters automate collection of data points (metrics).  
e.g. OpenShift, Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Issue trackers (JIRA, ServiceNow)

Metrics
: The data points that are collected from the providers.  
e.g. deploy_time, commit_time, failure_creation, failure_resolution

Measures
: Metrics calculated to represent an outcome. Each outcome is made measurable by a set of representative measures.  
e.g. Lead Time for Change, Deployment Frequency, Mean Time to Restore, Change Failure Rate
