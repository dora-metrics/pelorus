# About Pelorus

## The Name

A _Pelorus_ is a navigation device on a ship that indicates relative direction.  So, instead of telling you where North is, like what a compass would do, a pelorus tells you where you are heading by relating it to the direction you originally set off.

A transformation journey is unique for every organization, every team, and every individual. This is because no two transformation journeys begin at the same point. Even across varying teams within the same organization, there are variances in skillset, experience and context that impact what the journey will look like. Additionally, transformation isn't about reaching a destination. It's about continually solving problems that are impeding improvements. As organizations align on improving certain outcomes and setting goals, you can use Pelorus to help identify what goals to focus on and watch trends change as you continue to invest in improvements.

With this in mind, we hope that you use Pelorus to guide your transformation journey in a way that's best for you.
