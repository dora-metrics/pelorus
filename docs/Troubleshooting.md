# Troubleshooting

## Information not showing up in dashboard

We've included a troubleshooting script to check if your data is labeled correctly,
as required for [the deploy time exporter](GettingStarted.md#preparing-your-data)
and [the other exporters](GettingStarted.md#preparing-your-data-details).

With a [local dev environment](Development.md#dev-environment-setup) set up,
run `./scripts/troubleshooting/missing_labels -h` for information about how to use it.
