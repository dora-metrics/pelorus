Having worked with organizations around the world, we've found that very few of them are actually measuring their software delivery and operational performance in a meaningful way, despite the evidence that shows how this performance leads to higher organizational performance.

Fewer still are using that information to learn and continuously improve their organization.

As software delivery and operational performance has a proven correlation to organizational performance, we believe that there are other similar [_bridge outcomes_](../BridgeOutcomes/) that organizations can use to build a shared focus on measuring and improving to impact the organization as a whole.

We believe that a shared focus on measuring and improving on a specific set of business outcomes within an IT organization will result in a notable positive impact on the organization as a whole.

The mission of Pelorus is to help IT organizations use business value-based metrics to understand how technology-related investments impact organizational performance and to provide specific tools and guidance to help improve those metrics.
