For each outcome, use the following to guide a series of conversations to:

* **Collect.** Start by understanding the baseline first.

* **Execute.** Define an experiment by focusing on a deliverable with a specific target improvement on the metrics.
* **Remeasure.** Recapture metrics to validate hypotheses.
