# Measure things that matter

Pelorus is a monitoring tool that helps IT organizations measure their impact on the overall software delivery performance of their projects. It does this by gathering metrics about teams and organizational behaviors over time in some key areas of IT that have been shown to impact the value they deliver.

For a better understanding of software delivery metrics, you can read [@trevorquinn](https://github.com/trevorquinn)'s blog post [Metrics-Driven Approach to Transformation](https://www.openshift.com/blog/exploring-a-metrics-driven-approach-to-transformation) or watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-iB_KhUaQg).

Some of the key outcomes we would like Pelorus help us measure are:

## The Name

A **pelorus** is a navigation device on a ship that indicates relative direction. So, instead of telling you where North is, like what a compass would do, a pelorus tells you where you are heading by relating it to the direction you originally set off.

A transformation journey is unique for every organization, every team, and every individual. Because, every transformation journey begin at a different point. Even across varying teams within the same organization, there are variances in skillset, experience and context that impact what the journey will look like. Additionally, transformation is not about reaching a destination. It is about continually solving problems that are impeding improvements. As organizations align on improving certain outcomes and setting goals, you can use Pelorus to help identify what goals to focus on and watch trends change as you continue to invest in improvements.

With this in mind, we hope you use Pelorus to guide your transformation journey in the best possible way for you.

## Logo & Branding

Abstract rectangles and circles represent the various pieces of data collected in the Pelorus dashboard, open for interpretation by the user.

In situations where there is limited space to include a visual, the Pelorus icon could be used represent the tool.
