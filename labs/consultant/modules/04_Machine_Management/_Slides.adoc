*Machine Management*

[.text-center]
How OpenShift 4 manages the lifecycle of it's machine, or node, resources. 

ifdef::showscript[]

This includes the provisioning and deprovisioning of servers as well as the configuration and version of the Operating System. 

Machine Management can be 100% automated or you can choose a hybrid approach where you manage part of your nodes manually, such as you'd have to do with RHEL.


endif::showscript[]

== Machine API

[.text-center]
*Machine API Operator*
[.text-center]
Manages the lifecycle of specific purpose CRDs, controllers and RBAC objects that extend the Kubernetes API. This allows to convey desired state of machines in a cluster in a declarative fashion.

== Machine API

* Based on the upstream Cluster API project and custom OpenShift Container Platform resources
* Performs all node host provisioning management actions after the control plane is installed
* Machine API Operator deploys and configures:
** Controllers
** CRDs
* Machine controllers provision and deprovision Machines and Nodes
* Machine API resources all reside in `openshift-machine-api` namespace. They are not cluster scoped.

ifdef::showscript[]
Talk more in detail:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-aws.html

The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream Cluster API project and custom OpenShift Container Platform resources.

The two primary resources are: machines (A fundamental unit that describes the host for a Node) and machineSet (Groups of machines. MachineSets are to machines as ReplicaSets are to Pods. If you need more machines or must scale them down, you change the replicas field on the MachineSet to meet your compute need.).

All of these pieces make up the overall Machine API Operator.

The Machine API Operator manages the lifecycle of 
specific purpose CRDs, controllers and RBAC objects that 
extend the Kubernetes API. This allows to convey desired 
state of machines in a cluster in a declarative fashion.

== Nodes

[.text-center]
Nodes run Pods.

ifdef::showscript[]

The only job a node really has is to run Pods. There are things that can be done to nodes, such as labeling or tainting, that will influence _what_ Pods it runs. In the end, the job of a node is still to run Pods.

endif::showscript[]

== Nodes

* Core Kubernetes object
* Can be RHCOS (preferred) or RHEL for workers
* CRI-O used to run containers
* Managed as part of the OpenShift platform

ifdef::showscript[]
Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on Nodes. A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains the services necessary to run Pods, managed by the control plane.

Typically you have several nodes in a cluster; in a learning or resource-limited environment, you might have just one.

In this example, there are a total of 6 nodes.

Three of the nodes are masters and should not be used to run an user workloads.

Three of the nodes have the worker and another role. The worker role is a default role that is assigned to anything not a master. The other role assigned to these is arbitrary.

Roles are determined by the `node-role.kubernetes.io/<role-name>: ""` label.

== Machines

[.text-center]
*Machine*

[.text-center]
A representation and description of a host for a node.

ifdef::showscript[]
A fundamental unit that describes the host for a Node. It's an abstraction of the underlying "hardware" that makes it easier to work with the IaaS or cloud provider by just interacting with the Machine API and it's objects.

A machine has a providerSpec, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different cloud platforms. For example, a machine type for a worker node on Amazon Web Services (AWS) might define a specific machine type and required metadata.



endif::showscript[]

== Machines

* OpenShift objects based on CRD
* Represent underlying "hardware"
** Details provided in the `providerSpec`
* Machines do NOT run Pods
* Created by `MachineSet` or manually

ifdef::showscript[]

Machines are not core Kubernetes objects, but are created through the use of a CRD which extends the Kubernetes API and makes them native. Their only purpose is to act as a representation of the underlying instance, which will include details about that instance which can be use to manage the lifecycle of the instance.

Machines are very closely related to nodes, but they are *NOT* nodes. Only nodes run pods. The Kubernetes scheduler does not know what a Machine is and doesn't schedule Pods to run on a Machine.

Machines can be created manually or automatically from a MachineSet as more replicas are added.

Similar to the previous example, these are machines deployed in AWS. This was from an IPI install, so all of the nodes in this cluster are represented by Machines.

Here, you see the main difference is the different types, regions, and zones - which corresponde to AWS specifics.

If this were an Azure or GCP cluster, you'd see similar differences.

== MachineSet

[.text-center]
Groups of machines. MachineSets are to Machines as ReplicaSets are to Pods.

ifdef::showscript[]

MachineSets are the next layer up from Machines. MachineSets are separate objects and define a type of Machine they are responsible for as well as the number of replicas that should be deployed.

MachineSets contain the entire defition of the Machine as a template. 
This means that a MachineSet can create many copies of a specific Machine, but you would need multiple MachineSets if you have multiple types of Machines. 

For instance, if you have a MachineSet that provisions Machines with GPUs in them, you’d have to create a different MachineSet if you wanted to provision Machines without GPUs.

endif::showscript[]

== MachineSet

* OpenShift objects based on CRD
* Similar to a `Deployment` or `ReplicaSet`
* They create `Machines`
* Can be scaled using `replicas`
** Includes a `template` section, which describes how the `Machine` should be deployed
* When using IPI, `MachineSets` are created automatically for workers

TIP: It is a best practice to make changes at the `MachineSet` layer and let new `Machines` and `Nodes` be deployed with these changes.

ifdef::showscript[]

Like Machines, these are not core Kubernetes objects, but through the use of CRDs, they can be used natively via the Kubernetes API.

If you compare a MachineSet to a ReplicaSet, there are obviously differences in the details. But the overall structure is very similar in that you have a `spec` with a `template` that has a `spec` for the objects to be created, Machines in this case.

ifdef::showscript[]

In this example, there are 4 MachineSets listed, but only 3 of them have Machines deployed. This corresponds to the number of Machines you saw in the previous example.

When you scale a MachineSet up, a sequence of events happens
. The _DESIRED_ count increases
. When the new Machine object is created, the _CURRENT_ count increases
. When the Node finishes bootstrapping, the _READY_ count increases
. When the Node is available to run Pods, the _AVAILABLE_ count increases

== Machine Config Operator
.Components

* MachineConfigServer
**  Provide Ignition config to new machines joining the cluster.
* MachineConfigController
** Coordinates upgrade of machines to desired configurations defined by a MachineConfig object.
** Provides options to control upgrade for sets of machines individually.
* MachineConfigDaemon
**   Is scheduled on the machines in a cluster as a DaemonSet.
**   Is responsible for performing machine updates in OpenShift. 

ifdef::showscript[]
* machine-config-server:
All the machines joining the cluster must receive configuration from component running inside the cluster. MachineConfigServer provides the Ignition endpoint that all the new machines can point to receive their machine configuration.


* machineConfigController:
It generates Machine Configs for pre-defined roles (master and worker) and monitors whether an existing Machine Config CR (custom resource) is modified or new Machine Config CRs are created. When the controller detects any of those events, it will generate a new rendered Machine Config object that contains all of the Machine Configs based on MachineConfigSelector from each MachineConfigPool.


* machine-config-daemon:
The MachineConfigDaemon updates a machine to configuration defined by MachineConfig as instructed by the MachineConfigController.

The MachineConfigDaemon is also responsible for annotating a node with machineconfiguration.openshift.io/ssh=accessed when it detects an SSH access to the machine.

== Machine Config Pool - Overview
.The relationship among Machine Config Pool/Machine Configs and Worker Nodes

image::./images/machine-config-mapping.png[width=100%]


ifdef::showscript[]
The Machine Config Pool maps between nodes and Machine Configs. The Machine Config Pool has two selectors, and each selector matches machine configs with nodes.
* The Machine Config Pool associates nodes with Machine Configs
* The machineconfigpool objects track updates to a group of nodes: `oc describe machineconfigpool`
endif::showscript[]



== Machine Config Pool
.How Machine Config Pool selects Machine Configs and Worker

image::./images/machine-config-pool.png[width=100%]

ifdef::showscript[]
* The Render controller in the Machine Config Controller monitors the Machine Config Pool and generates static machine config objects named rendered-master-XXXX and rendered-worker-xxx. These objects can include multiple machine configs. 

* The Render controller then checks whether the nodes in the pool have applied the latest rendered-xxxx machine config. If the machine config pool changes, then the render controller creates a new rendered-xxx and applies it.
endif::showscript[]

== Machine Health Checks

* MachineHealthChecks automatically repairs unhealthy Machines in a particular MachinePool.

* The controller that observes a MachineHealthCheck resource checks for the status that you defined.

* If a machine fails the health check, it is automatically deleted and a new one is created to take its place.

* The controller drains and deletes only one node at a time.

* This process is not applicable to clusters where you manually provisioned the machines yourself.

ifdef::showscript[]
* You can configure and deploy a machine health check to automatically repair damaged machines in a machine pool.

* You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the machine API is operational.

* When a machine is deleted, you see a machine deleted event. To limit disruptive impact of the machine deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the maxUnhealthy threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, remediation stops so that manual intervention can take place.

== RHEL Workers

* RHEL nodes can be a worker, but not a master
** Only RHCOS nodes can be a master
* Only deployed using UPI method
* NOT controlled by Machine API - You take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance
** Performing system updates
** Applying patches
* Ansible playbooks used to add RHEL workers
* Subscription entitlement required for each node - not part of cluster-wide entitlement
* See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/machine_management/adding-rhel-compute.html#rhel-compute-requirements_adding-rhel-compute[list of system requirements^]

ifdef::showscript[]
* While RHCOS is the default operating system for all cluster machines, you can create compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, that use RHEL as their operating system.
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html

* In OpenShift Container Platform, you can add Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute, or worker, machines to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster. You can use RHEL as the operating system on only compute machines.

endif::showscript[]

== Cluster Autoscaler

* Based on upstream `ClusterAutoscaler` project and integrated with Machine API in OpenShift
* Controlled by the cluster autoscaler operator
* Adds Machines/Nodes to a cluster automatically
* Node and resource limits can be set so your cluster doesn't grow out of control
* Scale down policies are available
* Scaling is based on `Pending` pods that have exceeded the _Pod Priority Threshold_
* Requires `MachineAutoscalers` to function

ifdef::showscript[]

It scales the cluster automatically.

* The cluster autoscaler Operator manages this component. There can only be *one* cluster autoscaler deployed in a cluster. It is cluster scoped and itmust be named _*default*_.

* The cluster autoscaler is invoked when there are Pods in Pending state. This means that the scheduler can't find a node to run those Pods on. The cluster autoscaler will look for a type of node that is needed and, if possible, scale a MachineSet to add more of that type of node.

* The Pod priority threshold can be set so that the cluster autoscaler is not invoked for Pods that don't meet the threshold. For example, you can make it so that _BestEffort_ Pods don't meet this threshold and will not cause the cluster to scale up, but _Burstable_ and _Guaranteed_ pods would.

* Ensure that the maxNodesTotal value in the ClusterAutoscaler definition that you create is large enough to account for the total possible number of machines in your cluster. This value must encompass the number of control plane machines and the possible number of compute machines that you might scale to.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/machine_management/applying-autoscaling.html

endif::showscript[]

== Cluster Autoscaler
.Machine Autoscaler

* Minimum and maximum number of nodes for a `MachineSet`
* Must be assigned to each `MachineSet` that needs to participate in cluster autoscaling
* Does not actually invoke any scale up or scale down activities

ifdef::showscript[]

* You can set limits on the maximum number of nodes as well as the min/max of CPU & memory.

* A cluster autoscaler cannot directly increase the number of replicas of, or scale up, a MachineSet. It needs an intermediate resource called a MachineAutoscaler.

* The MachineAutoscaler adjusts the number of Machines in the MachineSets that you deploy in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

* Machine Autoscalers must be applied to every MachineSet that you want to participate in cluster autoscaling.
