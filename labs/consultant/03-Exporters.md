# Configuring Exporters

Exporters are the bots that gather the data we use to populate the dashboards. First, let's make some data!

## Step 1: Install the dummy application

In order for Pelorus to collect data, we are going to deploy an application pipeline to build and deploy a sample application.  Make your own fork of this sample repository so that you can make changes to it:

https://github.com/kkoller/container-pipelines.git
    
    git clone https://github.com/<Your Repo>/container-pipelines.git
    cd container-pipelines/basic-nginx
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p galaxy
    ansible-playbook -i ./.applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml

Let's take a look at the data points in the app that Pelorus will look to collect.

First, the build.

    oc get builds -l app.kubernetes.io/name -n basic-nginx-build

And then the deployed application.

    oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name -n basic-nginx-prod

In the next few sections, we'll deploy some exporters that collect data in a similar way to these commands.

## Step 2: Inspect your first exporter

### Deploy Time Exporter

Take a look at the exporter defined by default in `charts/pelorus/values.yaml`

    exporters:
      instances:
        # Values file for exporter helm chart
      - app_name: deploytime-exporter
        source_context_dir: exporters/
        extraEnv:
        - name: APP_FILE
          value: deploytime/app.py
        source_ref: master
        source_url: https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus.git

We get the information we need about deploy time from OpenShift, so this exporter works out-of-the-box!


## Step 3: 

### Commit Time Exporter

This exporter relies on information from Git, and so we have to configure our credentials before we can deploy it.

Confirm you have a [Github Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

Use the token information and the command below to generate a Github secret:

    oc create secret generic github-secret \
      --from-literal=GIT_USER=<username> \
      --from-literal=GIT_TOKEN=<personal access token> -n pelorus

Update the `values.yaml` and then upgrade our helm installation of Pelorus to add an additional exporter to the `instances` list:

      - app_name: committime-github
        env_from_secrets:
        - github-secret
        source_context_dir: exporters/
        extraEnv:
        - name: APP_FILE
          value: committime/app.py
        source_ref: master
        source_url: https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus.git

      helm upgrade pelorus charts/pelorus --namespace pelorus

Commit some changes to your fork of the sample app repository to see commit data populated in the Pelorus dashboard!

## Failure Exporter

For failures, we need to configure credentials for access to Jira.

Confirm you have a [Jira Personal Access Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html)

Use the token information and the command below to generate a Jira secret:

       oc create secret generic jira-secret \
        --from-literal=SERVER=<Jira Server> \
        --from-literal=USER=<username> \
        --from-literal=TOKEN=<personal access token> \
        --from-literal=PROJECT=<Jira Project> \
        -n pelorus

Once again, we will update our values.yaml and upgrade our Pelorus deployment.

      - app_name: failure-exporter
        env_from_secrets:
        - jira-secret
        source_context_dir: exporters/
        extraEnv:
        - name: APP_FILE
          value: failure/app.py
        source_ref: master
        source_url: https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus.git

      helm upgrade pelorus charts/pelorus --namespace pelorus

For Jira, we are all accessing a shared project.  We will create some failure tickets together so that we can see them appear in our dashboard!
