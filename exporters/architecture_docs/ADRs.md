## What goes in an ADR?

> Number/Date: A unique increasing number and date that usually follows the ADR-nnnn pattern to help sort them from old to new
> Title: Indicates the content
> Context (Why): Describes the current situation and why you made this decision or thought it necessaryâ€”some variations explicitly break out an "alternatives covered" section to ensure all considerations get recorded
> Decision (What/How): Describes the what and how of the feature
> Status: Describes the status; note that ADRs can be superseded later by newer ADRs
> Consequences: Describes the effect of the decision, listing positive and negative aspects
