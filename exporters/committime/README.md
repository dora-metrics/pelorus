# Commit Time Exporter

The job of the commit time exporter is to find relevant builds in OpenShift and associate a commit from the build's source code repository with a container image built from that commit. We capture a timestamp for the commit, and the resulting image hash, so that the Deploy Time Exporter can later associate that image with a production deployment.

In order for proper collection, we require that all builds associated with a particular application be labelled with the same `application=<app_name>` label.

Configuration can be found in the [config guide](./docs/Configuration.md)
